# WumpAsar

**An open-source alternative of Discord desktop's `app.asar` that can be used for remaking the client**

## Features

- **Forked from OpenAsar**: You will still get the goodness of OpenAsar
- **Works with packing**: Just modify `package.json` and off you go!

## Why?

OpenAsar is only there for existing installs. New installs (Repackaged with rePacker) will not work. OpenAsar ALSO requires to be online. Sure helps with storage but I think putting the assets alongside app.asar would be better.

## Does WumpAsar supports reUpdater?

Yes! In fact it will be the first priority to be compatible with.
